## Setup

Run `npm install`

## Running the app

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will
automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Testing

There is one e2e test that covers some of the app functionality, you can run it by running
`npx playwright test`

## Optional Goal

There is a file called ExtraCredit.md where I have written some thoughts on how to improve this
solution.
